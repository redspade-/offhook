IMPORTANT:

Further forks to GitHub for Offhook will now be ignored from now on. A private repository is recommended for private collaboration.

For future forks, use https://bitbucket.org/redspade/offhook instead.

BitBucket is free and has a better interface and privacy instead of GitHub. It also uses Git protocol, so it shouldn't be an issue.

Please send me a notification as soon as you read this. I'll be deleting the public repo on GitHub in favor of BitBucket's.

Eric.
